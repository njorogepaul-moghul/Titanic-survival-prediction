# Titanic Survival Prediction
**Overview**

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. It leverages features such as age, sex, passenger class, and fare to build predictive models.

**Features**

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering for improved model performance

Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest

Model evaluation with metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and Precision

Ready for deployment and integration

**Dataset**

The dataset is based on the Titanic passenger data commonly used in Kaggle competitions

Includes features like sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, embarked, class, who, alone

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Usage**

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/njorogepaul-moghul/Titanic-survival-prediction.git


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook to explore the analysis and model training.
